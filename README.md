## Short description
The Goonies is a platform game based on the movie in which the player takes the role of Cyclops Fratelli, often shortened to Sloth, who belongs by force to the Fratelli’s (formerly), a notorious family of Italian criminals. Despite his circumstances, he is an ally of the Goonies, a group of friends whose only hope lies in having exciting and powerful adventures.

The creation of this game involved building it entirely from the ground up using the C++ programming language and exploiting the capabilities of the Raylib library. Sprites and music from the original game were extracted and incorporated into this version. The game encompasses the initial stage found in the original game.
